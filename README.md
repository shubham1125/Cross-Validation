# Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is an important concept in machine learning which helps the data scientists in two major ways: it can and ensures that the artificial intelligence. Cross validation does that at the cost of resource consumption
Why Cross Validation?
train_test_split split the data randomly
Hence everytime we will build model with random data we may get different accuracies, so how you will conclude what is true accuracy of data.
Hence you will build many models with different train_test_split, and will take average of all accuracies to conclude final accuracies.
Types of cross-validation with functioning:-
1. Hold-out cross-validation
2. Leave One Out Cross Validation
3. K-Fold Cross Validation
4. Stratified k-fold Cross validation
5. Cross_val_score
